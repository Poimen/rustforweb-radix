# Composition

Use the `as_child` prop to compose Radix's functionality onto alternative element types or your own components.

<!-- TODO: All Radix primitive parts that render a DOM element accept an `as_child` prop. When `as_child` is set to true, Radix will not render a default DOM element, instead cloning the part's child and passing it the props and behavior required to make it functional. -->
